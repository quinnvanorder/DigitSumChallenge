/*
Write a method with the name sumDigits that has one int parameter called number.
If the parameter is >=10 then the method should proces the number and return sum of all digits, otherwise return -1 to indicate invalid value.
The numbers from 00-9 have 1 digit so we dont want to process them, also we dont want to process negative numbers so we also return -1 for negative numbers.
For example calling the method sumDigits(125) should return 8 since 1+2+5=8.
Calling the method sumDigits(1) should return -1 as per requirements described above.
Add some code to the main method to test out the sumdigits method to determine that it is working correctly for valid and invalid values passed as arguments.

Hint use n%10 to extract the least significant digit.
use n=n/10 to discard the least significant digit.
the method needs to be static like other methods so far in the course.
